# Advent of Code 2023

My attempts at solving AoC-2023 problems with Java. For more information check out the official website at: https://adventofcode.com/2023

### Goals

- Commit to the whole thing. Don't stop doing them halfway through.
- Use OOP Design Patterns more consciously, if needed.
- Make use of "Unit-Tests"
- Have fun!
