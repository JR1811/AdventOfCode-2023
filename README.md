## Goals

- Commit to the whole thing. Don't stop doing them halfway through.
- Use OOP Design Patterns more consciously, if needed.
- Make use of "Unit-Tests"

## Thoughts

### Day 01

Part one was done easily. It was only some simple string handling. The second part took me a bit longer since some hidden edge cases, like intersecting numbers, made using the `replace` method of String unviable. In the end, I went for a simple map of the alphabetical number and a list of only the digits in the string and let them compare their indexes to get the first and last viable number.

If the difficulty of those exercises keeps being on that level, it might be a bit harder this year compared to the last ones...
